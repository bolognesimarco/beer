An app starts with index.html which loads (in our case with Systemjs config) a script (main.ts)

The script bootstraps a module (app.module.ts)

The bootstrapped module is a BrowserModule and configures things (like routing). At last it 
declares all application components and bootstraps some components.

The components put templateUrl in page selectors.

html pages can have routerLink for directing configured component's templateUrl in same html's router-outlet
